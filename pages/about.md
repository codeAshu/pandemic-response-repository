# About

The open source projects catalogued in the Pandemic Response Repository are powering more efficient and effective public sector responses to the coronavirus pandemic. Many governments are struggling to find the right solutions and to share technology and content theyâ€™ve developed with others in need. The solutions listed here are reusable, easily shared among agencies, municipalities and countries, and can be adapted to local needs. The repository will be updated daily based on research by our team and submissions from around the world. We have not undertaken an independent code review of each solution.

The Pandemic Response Repository is the first phase of a more comprehensive Open Source Framework researched and developed by New America to strengthen and modernize government institutions. Across the public sector, private sector, and civil society, there is growing momentum to create open source, digital public goods that can deliver broad benefits for society and be easily modified to meet the needs of different communities. This work is intended to help build that movement. The Pandemic Response Repository is a joint project of the Digital Impact and Governance Initiative (DIGI) and Public Interest Technology (PIT) teams at New America.
