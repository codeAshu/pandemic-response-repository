    title: Open Opportunities platform
    summary: Open Opportunities is a United States government program that is creating a network of federal employees working together to build a more effective, efficient, responsive government by sharing skills and collaborating on projects that support the mission of an agency or the government as a whole. Here’s how Open Opportunities works - You come up with a great idea that would help your workplace, but you and your coworkers don’t have the skills to execute it. Rather than bringing in a contractor, you can post your project idea to Open Opportunities, where other people within your organization can see it and then work on it, if they’d like.
