The website is open source and can be replicated by other interested jurisdictions.                                                                       | Informational   | Web                | Tokyo          | Tokyo            | https://github.com/tokyo-metropolitan-gov/covid19    | https://stopcovid19.metro.tokyo.lg.jp/en/       |                                   | https://cfjslackin.herokuapp.com/ | MIT                |       | Yes            |       |
| 3   | TraceTogether                                              | Using Bluetooth, TraceTogether identifies other nearby phones with the app installed. It then tracks when you are in close proximity with these other persons, including timestamps. If the need arises, this information can then be used to identify close contacts based on the proximity and duration of an encounter between the two users. | Contact tracing | iPhone/Android app | Singapore      | Singapore        | To be opened soon                                    | https://bluetrace.io/                           | partnerships@tracetogether.gov.sg |                                   |                    |       |                |       |
